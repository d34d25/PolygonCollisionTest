Polygon: shape data, vertex info, no position or rotation!

Rigidbody: velocity, acceleration, mass, forces, physics update

Collider: uses Polygon + Transform for collision detection info

Entity: container for components â€” owns them, manages updates

Player: wraps entity

Scene: render and updates all entities, manages the collision detection and resolution, also handles the game state

Input: have a list of keys and a method that returns true/false for each key in that list that is being pressed
